# Description

This app was created as a learning exercise to gain experience with RESTFUL development, in this case integrating a React frontend and an Express/Node backend.

## Features

User can Create and Read comments on Blog posts.
User can view Blog posts.
Posts are sorted by date added and use pagination to load data in blocks

## Notes

App is not optimised for mobile devices, as this was primarily an exercise in getting the frontend and backend communicating I decided to keep the frontend design simple.

The backend of this application can be viewed here:

https://github.com/Legandjl/blog

And the standard admin frontend of the blog can be viewed here:

https://legandjl.github.io/blog_admin/

This application and the admin portal both use the same backend.

## Thoughts on the process

I enjoyed working on this application and have found that I prefer developing in this way as opposed to following the MVC pattern. I found it intuitive to have a clear separation of concerns of the frontend and the backend, and enjoyed jumping between the two and tweaking things. I feel I now have a solid grasp on the fundementals of developing applications in this way, and look forwards to building on this knowledge going forwards.
